		<p>Hello, my name is Alhoussine Khallil and I am an undergraduate Computer Science student attending Carleton University. 
     I have always had a passion for Computer Science. Despite its logical nature, computer science also involves a great deal of creativity.
	 Programmers must be able to think outside the box to come up with innovative solutions to complex problems, and that's what I like about it.
     I have gained valuable experience through University, and I have developed a strong set of skills in collaboration and communication. 
     I am also a lifelong learner and am constantly seeking out new challenges and opportunities to improve my knowledge and skills. 
     When I'm not or studying, I enjoy soccer video games, and cinema. 
     Overall, I am a dedicated and driven individual who is committed to pursuing my passions and making a positive impact in the world.</p>
